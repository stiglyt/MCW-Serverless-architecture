# Serverless architecture hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement an end-to-end solution using a supplied sample based on Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Event Grid, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring using various components of Microsoft Azure. You can implement the hands-on lab on your own. However, it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

At the end of the hands-on lab, you will have confidence in designing, developing, and monitoring a serverless solution that is resilient, scalable, and cost-effective.

## Overview

Contoso is rapidly expanding its toll booth management business to operate in a much larger area. As this is not their primary business, which is online payment services, they struggle with scaling up to meet the upcoming demand to extract license plate information from many new tollbooths, using photos of vehicles uploaded to cloud storage. Currently, they have a manual process where they send batches of images to a 3rd-party who manually transcodes the license plates to CSV files that they send back to Contoso to upload to their online processing system.

They want to automate this process in a way that is cost-effective and scalable. They believe serverless is the best route for them but do not have the expertise to build the solution.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully to understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The Solution diagram is described in the text following this diagram.](media/preferred-solution.png 'Solution diagram')

The solution begins with vehicle photos being uploaded to an **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** container as they are captured. An **Azure Event Grid** subscription is created against the data lake storage container. When a new blob is created, an event is triggered that calls the photo processing **Azure Function** endpoint, which in turn sends the photo to the **Computer Vision API** service to extract the license plate data. If processing is successful and the license plate number is returned. The function submits a new Event Grid event, along with the data, to an Event Grid topic with an event type called `savePlateData`. However, if the processing was unsuccessful, the function submits an Event Grid event to the topic with an event type called `queuePlateForManualCheckup`. Two separate functions are configured to trigger when new events are added to the Event Grid topic. Each filtering on a specific event type saves the relevant data to the appropriate **Azure Cosmos DB** collection for the outcome, using the Cosmos DB output binding. A **Logic App** that runs on a 15-minute interval executes an Azure Function via its HTTP trigger, responsible for obtaining new license plate data from Cosmos DB and exporting it to a new CSV file saved to Blob storage. If no new license plate records are found to export, the Logic App sends an email notification to the Customer Service department via their Office 365 subscription. **Application Insights** is used to monitor all Azure Functions in real-time as data is being processed through the serverless architecture. This real-time monitoring allows you to observe dynamic scaling first-hand and configure alerts when certain events take place. **Azure Key Vault** is used to securely store secrets, such as connection strings and access keys. Key Vault is accessed by the Function Apps through an access policy within Key Vault, assigned to each Function App's system-assigned managed identity.

- GitHub account. You can create a free account at <https://github.com>.

## Exercise 1: Develop and publish the photo processing and data export functions

**Duration**: 45 minutes

Use Visual Studio and its integrated Azure Functions tooling to develop and debug the functions locally and then publish them to Azure. The starter project solution, TollBooths, contains most of the code needed. You will add in the missing code before deploying to Azure.

### Task 1: Connect to the Lab VM

In this task, you create an RDP connection to your Lab virtual machine.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. Select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group from the list.

   ![The "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX" resource group is highlighted.](media/resource-groups.png "Resource groups list")

3. In the list of resources within your resource group, select the **LabVM Virtual machine** resource.

   ![The list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group are displayed, and LabVM is highlighted.](media/resource-group-resources-labvm.png "LabVM in resource group list")

4. On your LabVM blade, select **Connect** and **RDP** from the top menu.

   ![The LabVM blade is displayed, with the Connect button highlighted in the top menu.](media/connect-vm-rdp.png "Connect to Lab VM")

5. On the Connect to virtual machine blade, select **Download RDP File**, then open the downloaded RDP file.

   ![The Connect to virtual machine blade is displayed, and the Download RDP File button is highlighted.](media/connect-to-virtual-machine.png "Connect to virtual machine")

6. Select **Connect** on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection Dialog Box, the Connect button is highlighted.](media/remote-desktop-connection.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

7. Enter the following credentials when prompted, and then select **OK**:

   - **User name**: demouser
   - **Password**: Password.1!!

   ![The credentials specified above are entered into the Enter your credentials dialog.](media/rdc-credentials.png "Enter your credentials")

8. Select **Yes** to connect if prompted that the remote computer's identity cannot be verified.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, a warning states that the remote computer's identity cannot be verified and asks if you want to continue anyway. At the bottom, the Yes button is highlighted.](media/remote-desktop-connection-identity-verification-labvm.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

### Task 2: Open the starter solution in Visual Studio

1. On the LabVM, open File Explorer and navigate to `C:\ServerlessMCW\MCW-Serverless-architecture-main\Hands-on lab\lab-files\src\TollBooth`.

    > **Note:** Ensure the files are located under `C:\ServerlessMCW\`. If the files are located under a longer root path, such as  `C:\Users\workshop\Downloads\`, you will encounter build issues in later steps: `The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters`.

2. From the **TollBooth** folder opened in step 1, open the Visual Studio Solution by double-clicking the `TollBooth.sln` file.

    ![In the TollBooth folder in File Explorer, TollBooth.sln is highlighted.](media/file-explorer-toll-booth-sln.png "File Explorer")

3. If prompted about how to open the file, select **Visual Studio 2019**, and then select **OK**.

   ![Visual Studio 2019 is highlighted in the How do you want to open this file? dialog.](media/solution-file-open-with.png "Visual Studio 2019")

4. Sign in to Visual Studio using your Azure account credentials.

   ![The Sign in button is highlighted on the Visual Studio Welcome screen.](media/visual-studio-sign-in.png "Visual Studio 2019")

5. If prompted with a security warning, uncheck **Ask me for every project in this solution**, and then select **OK**.

6. Notice the solution contains the following projects:

   - `TollBooth`
   - `UploadImages`

   > **Note**: The UploadImages project is used for uploading a handful of car photos for testing the scalability of the serverless architecture.

   ![The two projects listed above are highlighted in Solution Explorer.](media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-projects.png 'Solution Explorer')

7. To validate connectivity to your Azure subscription from Visual Studio, open **Cloud Explorer** from the **View** menu and ensure that you can connect to your Azure subscription.

   ![In Cloud Explorer, the list of Azure subscriptions is shown. A single subscription is highlighted and expanded in the list.](media/vs-cloud-explorer.png 'Cloud Explorer')

   > **Note**: You may need to select the account icon and log in with your Azure account before seeing the resources below your subscription.

8. Return to the open File Explorer window and navigate back to the **src** subfolder. From there, open the **license plates** subfolder. It contains sample license plate photos used for testing out the solution. One of the images is guaranteed to fail OCR processing, which is meant to show how the workload is designed to handle such failures. The UploadImages project uses the **copyfrom** folder as a basis for the 1,000-photo upload option for testing scalability.

### Task 3: Finish the ProcessImage function

A few components within the starter project must be completed, which are marked as `TODO` in the code. The first set of `TODO` items we address are in the `ProcessImage` function. We will update the `FindLicensePlateText` class that calls the Computer Vision service and the `SendToEventGrid` class, which is responsible for sending processing results to the Event Grid topic you created earlier.

> **Note**: **Do not** update the version of any NuGet package. This solution is built to function with the NuGet package versions currently defined within. Updating these packages to newer versions could cause unexpected results.

1. From the Visual Studio **View** menu, select **Task List**.

    ![The Visual Studio Menu displays, with View and Task List selected.](media/vs-task-list-link.png 'Visual Studio Menu')

2. There, you will see a list of `TODO` tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed.

    ![A list of TODO tasks, including their description, project, file, and line number are displayed.](media/vs-task-list.png 'TODO tasks')

    > **Note**: If the TODO ordering is out of order, select **Description** to sort it in a logical order.

3. In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, expand the **TollBooth** project and double-click `ProcessImage.cs` to open the file.

    > Notice the Run method is decorated with the **FunctionName** attribute, which sets the name of the Azure Function to `ProcessImage`. This is triggered by HTTP requests sent to it from the Event Grid service. You tell Event Grid that you want to get these notifications at your function's URL by creating an event subscription, which you will do in a later task, in which you subscribe to blob-created events. The function's trigger watches for new blobs being added to the images container of the data lake storage account that was created by the ARM template in the Before the hands-on lab guide. The data passed to the function from the Event Grid notification includes the URL of the blob. That URL is, in turn, passed to the input binding to obtain the uploaded image from data lake storage.

    ![The ProcessImage.cs file is highlighted within the TollBooth project in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer.](media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-process-image.png "Solution Explorer")

4. In the **Task List** pane at the bottom of the Visual Studio window, double-click the `TODO 1` item, which will take you to the first `TODO` task.

    ![TODO 1 is highlighted in the Visual Studio Task List.](media/visual-studio-task-list-todo-1.png "Task List")

5. Update the code on the line below the `TODO 1` comment, using the following code:

    ```csharp
    // **TODO 1: Set the licensePlateText value by awaiting a new FindLicensePlateText.GetLicensePlate method.**
    licensePlateText = await new FindLicensePlateText(log, _client).GetLicensePlate(licensePlateImage);
    ```

6. Double-click `TODO 2` in the Task List to open the `FindLicensePlateText.cs` file.

    > This class is responsible for contacting the Computer Vision service's Read API to find and extract the license plate text from the photo using OCR. Notice that this class also shows how you can implement a resilience pattern using [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly), an open-source .NET library that helps you handle transient errors. This is useful for ensuring that you do not overload downstream services, in this case, the Computer Vision service. This will be demonstrated later when visualizing the Function's scalability.

    ![TODO 2 is highlighted in the Visual Studio Task List.](media/visual-studio-task-list-todo-2.png "Task List")

7. The following code represents the completed task in FindLicensePlateText.cs:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 2: Populate the below two variables with the correct AppSettings properties.
    var uriBase = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("computerVisionApiUrl");
    var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("computerVisionApiKey");
    ```

8. Double-click `TODO 3` in the Task List to open `SendToEventGrid.cs`.

    > This class is responsible for sending an Event to the Event Grid topic, including the event type and license plate data. Event listeners will use the event type to filter and act on the events they need to process. Please make a note of the event types defined here (the first parameter passed into the Send method), as they will be used later when creating new functions in the second Function App you provisioned earlier.

    ![TODO 3 is highlighted in the Visual Studio Task List.](media/visual-studio-task-list-todo-3.png "Task List")

9. Use the following code to complete `TODO 3` in `SendToEventGrid.cs`:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 3: Modify send method to include the proper eventType name value for saving plate data.
    await Send("savePlateData", "TollBooth/CustomerService", data);
    ```

10. `TODO 4` is  a few lines down from step 9 in the `else` block in `SendLicensePlateData(LicensePlateData data)`.  Use the following code to complete `TODO 4` in `SendToEventGrid.cs`:

    ```csharp
    // TODO 4: Modify send method to include the proper eventType name value for queuing plate for manual review.
    await Send("queuePlateForManualCheckup", "TollBooth/CustomerService", data);
    ```

    > **Note**: `TODOs` 5, 6, and 7 will be completed in later steps of the guide.

### Task 4: Publish the Function App from Visual Studio

In this task, you will publish the Function App from the starter project in Visual Studio to the existing Function App you provisioned in Azure.

1. Navigate to the **TollBooth** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio.

2. Right-click the **TollBooth** project and select **Publish** from the context menu.

    ![In Solution Explorer, the TollBooth is selected, and within its context menu, the Publish item is selected.](media/image39.png "Solution Explorer")

3. In the Publish window, select **Azure**, then select **Next**.

    ![In the Pick a publish target window, the Azure Functions Consumption Plan is selected in the left pane. The Select Existing radio button is selected in the right pane, and the Run from package file (recommended) checkbox is unchecked. The Create Profile button is also selected.](media/vs-publish-function.png 'Publish window')

4. Select **Azure Function App (Windows)** for the specific target, then select **Next**.

    ![The specific target screen of the Publish dialog is shown with the Azure Function App (Windows) item selected and the Next button highlighted.](media/vs-publish-specific-target.png "Publish specific target")

5. In the **Publish** dialog:

    - Select your **Subscription** (1).
    - Select **Resource Group** under **View** (2).
    - In the **Function Apps** box (3), expand your **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group. Select the Function App whose name ends with **Functions**.
    - **Uncheck the `Run from package file` option** (4).

    ![In the App Service form, Resource Group displays in the View field, and in the tree-view below, the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX folder is expanded, and TollBoothFunctionApp is selected.](media/vs-publish-function2.png 'Publish window')

    > **Important**: We do not want to run from a package file because when we deploy from GitHub later on, the build process will be skipped if the Function App is configured for a zip deployment.

6. Select **Finish**.  This creates an Azure Function App publish XML file with a `.pubxml` extension.

7. Select **Publish** to start the process. Watch the Output window in Visual Studio as the Function App publishes. When it is finished, you should see a message that says, `========== Publish: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 skipped ==========`.

    > **Note**: If prompted to update the version of the function on Azure, select **Yes**.

    ![The Publish button is selected.](media/vs-publish-function3.png "Publish")

8. Using a new tab or instance of your browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

9. Open the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, then select the **TollBoothFunctions** Azure Function App, to which you just published.

10. Select **Functions** (1) in the left-hand navigation menu. You should see both functions you just published from the Visual Studio solution listed (2).

    ![In the Function Apps blade, in the left tree-view, both TollBoothFunctionApp and Functions (Read Only) are expanded. Beneath Functions (Read Only), two functions ExportLicensePlates and ProcessImage are highlighted.](media/dotnet-functions.png 'TollBoothFunctionApp blade')

11. Now, we need to add an Event Grid subscription to the ProcessImage function, so the function is triggered when new images are added to the data lake storage container.

    - Select the **ProcessImage** function.
    - Select **Integration** on the left-hand menu (1).
    - Select **Event Grid Trigger (eventGridEvent)** (2).
    - Select **Create Event Grid subscription** (3).

    ![In the TollboothFunctionApp tree-view, the ProcessImage function is selected. In the code window pane, the Add Event Grid subscription link is highlighted.](media/processimage-add-eg-sub.png 'ProcessImage function')

12. On the **Create Event Subscription** blade, specify the following configuration options:

    - **Name**: Enter a unique value, similar to **processimagesub** (ensure the green check mark appears).
    - **Event Schema**: Select **Event Grid Schema**.
    - **Topic Type**: Select **Storage Accounts (Blob & GPv2)**.
    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
    - **Resource Group**: Select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group from the list of existing resource groups.
    - **Resource**: Select your data lake storage account. This should be the only account listed and will start with `datalake`.
    - **System Topic Name**: Enter **processimagesubtopic**.
    - **Filter to Event Types**: Select only the **Blob Created** from the event types dropdown list.
    - **Endpoint Type**: Leave `Azure Function` as the Endpoint Type.
    - **Endpoint**: Leave as `ProcessImage`.

    ![In the Create event subscription form, the fields are set to the previously defined values.](media/process-image-sub-topic.png)

13. Select **Create**.

## Exercise 2: Create functions in the portal

**Duration**: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will create two new Azure Functions written in Node.js, using the Azure portal. These will be triggered by Event Grid and output to Azure Cosmos DB to save the results of license plate processing done by the ProcessImage function.

## Exercise 3: Monitor your functions with Application Insights

**Duration**: 15 minutes

Application Insights can be integrated with Azure Function Apps to provide robust monitoring for your functions. In this exercise, you examine telemetry in the Application Insights account that you created when provisioning the Function Apps. Since you associated the Application Insights account with the Function Apps when creating them, the Application Insights telemetry key was added to the Function App configuration for you.

### Help references

| Live Metrics Stream: Monitor & Diagnose with 1-second latency | <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-live-stream> |

### Task 1: Use the Live Metrics Stream to monitor functions in real-time

1. Open the **appinsights** Application Insights resource from within your lab resource group.

    ![The Application Insights instance is highlighted in the resource group.](media/resource-group-application-insights.png "Application Insights")

2. In Application Insights, select **Live Metrics Stream** under **Investigate** in the left-hand navigation menu.

    ![In the TollBoothMonitor blade, in the pane under Investigate, Live Metrics Stream is selected. ](media/live-metrics-link.png 'TollBoothMonitor blade')

3. Leave the Live Metrics Stream open and return to the starter app solution in Visual Studio on the LabVM.

4. Navigate to the **UploadImages** project using the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio. Right-click on **UploadImages** project and select **Properties**.

    ![In Solution Explorer, the UploadImages project is expanded, and Properties is selected from the right-click context menu.](media/vs-uploadimages.png 'Solution Explorer')

5. Select **Debug** in the left-hand menu, then paste the connection string for your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account into the **Application arguments** text field.

   > **Note**: To obtain the connection string:
   >
   > - In the Azure portal, navigate to the **datalake{SUFFIX}** storage account.
   > - Select **Access keys** from the left menu.
   > - Copy the **Connection string** value of **key1**.
   >  

   Providing this value will ensure that the required connection string is added as an argument each time you run the application. Additionally, the combination of adding the value here and having the `.gitignore` file included in the project directory will prevent the sensitive connection string from being added to your source code repository in a later step.

    ![The Debug menu item and the command line arguments text field are highlighted.](media/vs-command-line-arguments.png "Properties - Debug")

6. Save your changes by selecting the Save icon on the Visual Studio toolbar.

7. Right-click the **UploadImages** project in the Solution Explorer, select **Debug**, then **Start New Instance** from the context menu.

    ![In Solution Explorer, the UploadImages project is selected. From the context menu, Debug then Start New Instance is selected.](media/vs-debug-uploadimages.png 'Solution Explorer')

    >**Note:** Ensure the files are located under `C:\ServerlessMCW\`. If the files are located under a longer root path, such as `C:\Users\workshop\Downloads\`, then you will encounter build issues in later steps: `The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters.`

8. When the console window appears, enter **1** and press **ENTER**. This action uploads a handful of car photos to the images container of your Blob storage account.

    ![A Command prompt window displays, showing images being uploaded.](media/image69.png 'Command prompt window')

9. Switch back to your browser window with the Live Metrics Stream still open within Application Insights. You should start seeing new telemetry arrive, showing the number of servers online, the incoming request rate, CPU process amount, etc. You can select some of the sample telemetry in the list to the side to view output data.

    ![The Live Metrics Stream window displays information for the two online servers. Displaying line and point graphs including incoming requests, outgoing requests, and overall health. To the side is a list of Sample Telemetry information. ](media/image70.png 'Live Metrics Stream window')

10. Leave the Live Metrics Stream window open once again and close the console window for the image upload. Debug the UploadImages project again, then enter **2** and press **ENTER**. This will upload 1,000 new photos.

    ![The Command prompt window displays with image uploading information.](media/image71.png 'Command prompt window')

11. Switch back to the Live Metrics Stream window and observe the activity as the photos are uploaded. You can see the number of servers online, which translates to the number of Function App instances running between both Function Apps. You should also notice things such as a steady cadence for the Request Rate monitor, the Request Duration hovering below \~200ms second, and the Incoming Requests roughly matching the Outgoing Requests.

    ![In the Live Metrics Stream window, two servers are online under Incoming Requests. The Request Rate heartbeat line graph is selected, as is the Request Duration dot graph. Under Overall Health, the Process CPU heartbeat line graph is also selected, the similarities between this graph and the Request Rate graph under Incoming Requests are highlighted for comparison.](media/image72.png 'Live Metrics Stream window')

12. After this has run for a while, close the image upload console window once again, but leave the Live Metrics Stream window open.

### Task 2: Observe your functions dynamically scaling when resource-constrained

In this task, you will change the Computer Vision API to the Free tier. This will limit the number of requests to the OCR service to 10 per minute. Once changed, run the UploadImages console app to upload 1,000 images again. The resiliency policy is programmed into the FindLicensePlateText.MakeOCRRequest method of the ProcessImage function will begin exponentially backing off requests to the Computer Vision API, allowing it to recover and lift the rate limit. This intentional delay will significantly increase the function's response time, causing the Consumption plan's dynamic scaling to kick in, allocating several more servers. You will watch all of this happen in real-time using the Live Metrics Stream view.

1. Open your Computer Vision API service by opening the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group and then selecting the resource that starts with **computervision-**.

    ![The computervision Computer vision resource is highlighted in the list of services in the resource group.](media/resource-group-computer-vision-resource.png "Resource group")

2. Select **Pricing tier** under **Resource Management** in the menu. Select the **F0 Free** pricing tier, then choose **Select**.

    > **Note**: If you already have an **F0** free pricing tier instance, you will not be able to create another one.

    ![In the Cognitive Services blade, under Resource Management, the Pricing tier item is selected. In the Choose your pricing tier blade, the F0 Free option is selected.](media/image73.png 'Choose your pricing tier blade')

3. Switch to Visual Studio, debug the **UploadImages** project again, then enter **2** and press **ENTER**. This will upload 1,000 new photos.

    ![The Command prompt window displays image uploading information.](media/image71.png 'Command Prompt window')

4. Switch back to the Live Metrics Stream window and observe the activity as the photos are uploaded. After running for a couple of minutes, you should start to notice a few things. The Request Duration will begin to increase over time. As this happens, you should notice more servers being brought online. Each time a server is brought online, you should see a message in the Sample Telemetry stating that it is "Generating 2 job function(s)", followed by a Starting Host message. You should also see messages logged by the resilience policy that the Computer Vision API server is throttling the requests. This is known by the response codes sent back from the service (429). A sample message is "Computer Vision API server is throttling our requests. Automatically delaying for 16000ms".

    > **Note**: If you select a sample telemetry item and cannot see its details, drag the resize bar at the bottom of the list up to resize the details pane.

    ![In the Live Metrics Stream window, 11 servers are now online.](media/image74.png 'Live Metrics Stream window')

5. After this has run for some time, close the UploadImages console to stop uploading photos.

6. Navigate back to the **Computer Vision** resource in the Azure portal and set the pricing tier back to **S1 Standard**.

## Exercise 4: Explore your data in Azure Cosmos DB

**Duration**: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will use the Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer in the portal to view saved license plate data.

> **Note:** Ensure that your IP address has been added to the IP list under the **Firewall settings** in your Azure Cosmos DB account. If not, you will not see the License Plates data within Azure Cosmos DB. You completed this step in the Before the hands-on lab guide.

9. Paste the SQL query below into the query window. This query counts the number of processed documents that have not been exported:

    ```sql
    SELECT VALUE COUNT(1) FROM c WHERE c.exported = false
    ```

10. Execute the query and observe the results. In our case, we have 669 processed documents that need to be exported.

    ![In the Query window, the previously defined SQL query displays. Under Results, the number 669 is highlighted.](media/cosmos-query-results.png 'Query 1 tab')

## Exercise 5: Create the data export workflow

**Duration**: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you create a new Logic App for your data export workflow. This Logic App will execute periodically and call your ExportLicensePlates function, then conditionally send an email if there were no records to export.

    ![Under Azure Functions, under Actions (2), Azure Functions (ExportLicensePlates) is selected.](media/logic-app-select-export-function.png 'Logic App Designer Azure Functions section')

    > This function does not require any parameters that need to be sent when it gets called.

9. Select **+ New step**, then search for `condition`. Select the **Condition** Control option from the Actions search result.

    ![In the logic app designer, in the ExportLicensePlates section, the parameter field is left blank. In the Choose an action box, condition is entered as the search term, and the Condition Control item is selected from the Actions list.](media/logicapp-add-condition.png 'Logic App Designer ExportLicensePlates section')

10. For the **value** field, select the **Status code** parameter. Ensure the operator is set to **is equal to**, then enter **200** in the second value field.

    > **Note**: This evaluates the status code returned from the ExportLicensePlates function, which will return a 200 code when license plates are found and exported. Otherwise, it sends a 204 (NoContent) status code when no license plates were discovered that need to be exported. We will conditionally send an email if any response other than 200 is returned.

    ![The first Condition field displays Status code. The second, drop-down menu field displays is equal to, and the third field is set to 200.](media/logicapp-condition.png 'Condition fields')

11. We will ignore the If true condition because we don't want to perform an action if the license plates are successfully exported. Select **Add an action** within the **If false** condition block.

    ![Under the Conditions field is an If true (green checkmark) section and an if false (red x) section. In the If false section, the Add an action button is selected.](media/logicapp-condition-false-add.png 'Logic App Designer Condition fields if true/false ')

15. You should see a message stating that you successfully pushed your changes to the GitHub repository.

    ![The message is displayed.](media/vs-git-push-success-main.png "Successfully pushed")

16. Go back to Deployment Center for your Function App in the portal. You should see an entry for the deployment kicked off by this last commit. Check the timestamp on the message to verify that you are looking at the latest one. **Make sure the deployment completes before continuing**.

    ![The latest deployment is displayed in the Deployment Center.](media/functionapp-dc-latest.png 'Deployment Center')

## Exercise 7: Rerun the workflow and verify data export

**Duration**: 10 minutes

With the latest code changes in place, run your Logic App and verify that the files are successfully exported.

### Task 1: Rerun Upload Images

1. In Visual Studio, right-click the **UploadImages** project in the Solution Explorer. Select **Debug**, then **Start New Instance** from the context menu.

2. When the console window appears, enter `2` and press **ENTER**. This action uploads a handful of car photos to the images container of your Blob storage account.  This should get data to trigger the ExportLicensePlates function.

### Task 2: Run the Logic App

1. Open your **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group in the Azure portal, then select your **logicapp** Logic App resource from the list.

2. From the **Overview** blade, select **Enable** (if you disabled the Logic App previously).

    ![In the TollBoothLogic Logic app blade, Overview is selected in the left menu, and the Enable enable button is selected in the right pane.](media/image113.png 'TollBoothLogic blade')

3. Now select **Run Trigger**, then select **Run** to execute your workflow immediately.

    ![In the TollBoothLogic Logic app blade, Run Trigger and Run are selected.](media/image114.png 'TollBoothLogic blade')

4. Select the **Refresh** button next to the Run Trigger button to refresh your run history. Select the latest run history item. If the expression result for the condition is **true**, then that means the CSV file should've been exported to data lake storage. Be sure to disable the Logic App, so it doesn't keep sending you emails every 15 minutes. Please note that it may take longer than expected to start running in some cases.

    ![In Logic App Designer, in the Condition section, under Inputs, true is highlighted.](media/image115.png 'Logic App Designer ')

### Task 3: View the exported CSV file

1. Open your **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group in the Azure portal, then select the **datalake** Storage account resource you provisioned to store uploaded photos and exported CSV files.

2. From the left menu of the storage account, select **Containers**, then choose the **export** container.

    ![The Containers option is selected on the left menu and the export container is highlighted from the container listing.](media/storage-containers.png 'Storage container listing')

3. You should see at least one recently uploaded CSV file. Select the filename to view its properties.

    ![In the Export blade, under Name, a .csv file is selected.](media/blob-export.png 'Export blade')

4. Select **Download** in the blob properties window.

    ![In the Blob properties blade, the Download button is selected.](media/blob-download.png 'Blob properties blade')

5. The CSV file should look similar to the following:

    ![A CSV file displays with the following columns: FileName, LicensePlateText, TimeStamp, and LicensePlateFound.](media/csv.png 'CSV file')

6. The ExportLicensePlates function updates all the records it exported by setting the exported value to true. This makes sure that only new records since the last export are included in the next one. Verify this by re-executing the script in Azure Cosmos DB that counts the number of documents in the Processed collection where exported is false. It should return 0 unless you've subsequently uploaded new photos.

## After the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 10 minutes

In this exercise, attendees will delete any Azure resources created in support of the lab.

### Task 1: Delete the resource group in which you placed your Azure resources

1. From the Portal, navigate to your **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group and select **Delete** in the toolbar at the top.

2. Confirm the deletion by re-typing the **resource group name** and selecting **Delete**.

3. If you created a different resource group for your virtual machine, be sure to delete that as well.

### Task 2: Delete the GitHub repo

[Optional] In this task, you delete the GitHub repository you created for this lab.

1. Open <https://www.github.com>, then select your profile icon and select **Your repositories**.

2. Navigate to your repo and select it.

3. Select the **Settings** tab, scroll to the bottom, select **Delete this repository**.

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
