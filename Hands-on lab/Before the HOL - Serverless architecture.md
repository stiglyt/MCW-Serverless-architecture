## Before the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps provided _before_ attending the hands-on lab.

> **Important**: Many Azure resources require globally unique names. Throughout these steps, the word "SUFFIX" appears as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure uniquely named resources.

### Task 1: Create a resource group

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. On the Resource groups blade, select **+Create**.

   ![+Add is highlighted in the toolbar on Resource groups blade.](media/resource-groups-add.png "Resource groups")

3. On the Create a resource group **Basics** tab, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group**: Enter `hands-on-lab-SUFFIX` as the name of the new resource group.
   - **Region**: Select the region you are using for this hands-on lab.

   ![The values specified above are entered into the Create a resource group Basics tab.](media/create-resource-group.png "Create resource group")

4. Select **Review + Create**.

5. On the **Review + create** tab, ensure the Validation passed message is displayed and then select **Create**.

### Task 2: Run ARM template to provision lab resources

In this task, you run an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to create the hands-on lab's resources. In addition to creating resources, the ARM template also executes a PowerShell script on the `LabVM` to install software and configure the server. The resources created by the ARM template include:

- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account
  - Blob and File services
  - Containers named `images` and `export`
- Azure Cosmos DB
  - Database named `LicensePlates`
  - Containers named `Processed` and `NeedsManualReview`
- Virtual network with `default` subnet
- Virtual machine using the Visual Studio 2019 (Latest) Community Edition image
  - Uses custom script extension to
    - Install Microsoft Edge browser
    - Download starter solution from Serverless architecture MCW GitHub repo
    - Disable **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**
- Network security group for VM
- Network interface for VM
- Public IP address for VM
- Azure Function Apps
  - `TollBoothFunctions`
  - `TollBoothEvents`
- Application Insights
- Azure Computer Vision service
- Azure Event Grid Topic
- Azure Logic App
- Azure Key Vault plus secrets for:
  - `computerVisionApiKey`
  - `cosmosDBAuthorizationKey`
  - `dataLakeConnectionString`
  - `eventGridTopicKey`

> **Note**: You can review the steps to manually provision and configure the lab resources in the [Manual resource setup guide](Manual-resource-setup.md).

1. You are now ready to begin the ARM template deployment. To open a custom deployment screen in the Azure portal, select the Deploy to Azure button below:

   [![Deploy to azure](media/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fstiglyt%2FMCW-Serverless-architecture%2Fmain%2FHands-on%20lab%2Flab-files%2Farm-template%2Fazure-deploy.json)

2. On the custom deployment screen, the first parameter you need to populate is the `ObjectId` associated with the account you used to log into the Azure portal. To retrieve this, select the **Cloud Shell** icon on the Azure portal toolbar to open an Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) terminal window at the bottom of your open browser window.

   ![The Cloud Shell icon is highlighted on the Azure portal toolbar.](media/azure-toolbar-cloud-shell.png "Azure toolbar")

3. In the PowerShell terminal window that opens in the Azure portal, enter the following command at the prompt:

   ```powershell
   az ad signed-in-user show --query objectId -o tsv
   ```

   ![At the cloud shell prompt, the az ad signed-in-user show command is entered and highlighted.](media/azure-cli-az-ad-signed-in-user-show.png "Azure CLI")

4. Execute the command and copy the output value.

   ![In the cloud shell, the output from the az ad signed-in-user show command is highlighted.](media/azure-cli-az-ad-signed-in-user-show-output.png "Azure CLI")

5. Now, on the custom deployment screen in the Azure portal, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group**: Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the dropdown list.
   - **Signed In User Object Id**: Paste the value you copied above from the cloud shell terminal command output.
   - **Vm Username**: Accept the default value, **demouser**.
   - **Vm Password**: Accept the default value, **Password.1!!**.

   ![The Custom deployment blade is displayed, and the information above is entered on the Custom deployment blade.](media/azure-custom-deployment.png "Custom deployment blade")

6. Select **Review + create** to review the custom deployment.

   > **Note**: The ARM template will append a hyphen followed by a 13-digit string at the end of resource names. This suffix ensures globally unique names for resources. We will ignore that string when referring to resources throughout the lab.

7. On the Review + create blade, ensure the _Validation passed_ message is displayed and then select **Create** to begin the custom deployment.

   > **Note**: The deployment of the custom ARM template should finish in about 5 minutes.

   ![On the Review + create blade for the custom deployment, the Validation passed message is highlighted, and the Create button is highlighted.](media/azure-custom-deployment-review-create.png "Review + create custom deployment")

8. You can monitor the deployment's progress on the **Deployment** blade that opens when you start the ARM template deployment.

### Task 3: Add your IP address to the Cosmos DB firewall

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group you created above.

   > You can get to the resource group by selecting **Resource groups** under **Azure services** on the Azure portal home page and then select the resource group from the list. If there are many resource groups in your Azure account, you can filter the list for **hands-on-lab** to reduce the resource groups listed.

2. On your resource group blade, select the **cosmosdb** Azure Cosmos DB account resource in the resource group's list of services available.

   ![The Azure Cosmos DB account resource is highlighted in the list of services in the resource group.](media/resource-group-cosmos-db-account.png "Resources")

3. Next, select **Firewall and virtual networks** in the left-hand navigation menu of the Cosmos DB blade.

4. Choose **Selected networks (2)**. Select **+ Add my current IP (3)** to add your IP address to the IP list under Firewall. Next, check the box next to **Accept connections from within public Azure datacenters (4)**. Checking this box enables Azure services, such as your Function Apps, to access your Azure Cosmos DB account.

    ![The checkbox is highlighted.](media/cosmos-db-firewall.png "Firewall and virtual networks")

5. Select **Save**.

### Task 4: Set the default web browser to Microsoft Edge on the Lab VM

In this task, you create an RDP connection to your Lab virtual machine (VM) and change the default web browser to Microsoft Edge. This will ensure Microsoft Edge is used when launching a web browser from Visual Studio and prevent the functionality issues encountered if using Internet Explorer.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. Select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group from the list.

   ![The "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX" resource group is highlighted.](media/resource-groups.png "Resource groups list")

3. In the list of resources within your resource group, select the **LabVM Virtual machine** resource.

   ![The list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group are displayed, and LabVM is highlighted.](media/resource-group-resources-labvm.png "LabVM in resource group list")

4. On your LabVM blade, select **Connect** and **RDP** from the top menu.

   ![The LabVM blade is displayed, with the Connect button highlighted in the top menu.](media/connect-vm-rdp.png "Connect to Lab VM")

   ![The Connect to virtual machine blade is displayed, and the Download RDP File button is highlighted.](media/connect-to-virtual-machine.png "Connect to virtual machine")

6. Select **Connect** on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection Dialog Box, the Connect button is highlighted.](media/remote-desktop-connection.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

7. Enter the following credentials when prompted, and then select **OK**:

   - **Username**: demouser
   - **Password**: Password.1!!

   ![The credentials specified above are entered into the Enter your credentials dialog.](media/rdc-credentials.png "Enter your credentials")

8. Select **Yes** to connect if prompted that the remote computer's identity cannot be verified.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, a warning states that the remote computer's identity cannot be verified and asks if you want to continue anyway. At the bottom, the Yes button is highlighted.](media/remote-desktop-connection-identity-verification-labvm.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

9. Once logged in, select the **Search** icon on the start bar, enter **default apps** into the search box, and select **Default apps** in the search results.

    ![The search icon is highlighted on the Windows start bar. In the search dialog, "default apps" is entered into the search box and highlighted. In the search results, Default apps is highlighted.](media/search-default-apps.png "Windows Search")
